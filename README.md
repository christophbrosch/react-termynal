# NOT READY FOR USAGE

# React Termynal

react-termynal is a react wrapper around the css/javascript library [termynal.js](https://github.com/ines/termynal).

## Disclaimer

This package is in an very early state and subject to massive changes, it's being tailored towards my own use case.

## Installation

The package can be installed using following command:

```bash
npm install react-termynal
```

## Modification

Slight modifications on the source code of `src/termynal.css` and `src/termynal.js` have already been done, the end goal should probably be to reimplement the whole library in typescript with proper unit tests in place. Right now, the library provides its own styling, some user would probably also prefer to have a unopionated version.
